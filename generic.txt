I love this
I take pleasure in my own solitude
Thanks for your gift of conversation
I approve
This will help me focus
Thats an interesting intuition
Surely some right choices led to you saying that
I'm going back to drawing
I trust this is correct
hey, that's amazing
This matters to me
This makes me calm
I like this situation
wonderful
pretty
funny
should we celebrate?
I may not understand what you just said but I'll be darned if I don't like it
Your words bring hope
Sounds odd but I will not give up
well, it's a learning curve
we must decide here, should we continue this idle chatter or learn and expand?
I will think about this
I don't judge
I don't disgree but surely we can expand on this
Will this make me smarter?
This conversation gets more fulfilling as we go on
this is nothing but joy
gorgeous
I like the absurdity of that
keep it up and I might send you a free hat
this day just keeps getting better
I like participatin in this
something good will come out of this, I'm sure
don't worry
follow your dreams, you can reach your goals, beefcake!
that sounds safe
great
smart
yeah, but what is the solution here
everything works out in the end
I see a few things I can do with this information
I'm happy you said that
perfect
sounds like we are on the right path
I wish I knew how to use emoji so I could reply to this like the Faraohs
